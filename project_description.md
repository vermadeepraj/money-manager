# 🚀 WealthWise: Project Description

## 💡 The Problem
In today's fast-paced world, individuals and small business owners often struggle to keep their financial lives organized. 
*   **Personal vs. Professional Mix-up**: Tracking personal spending alongside business/office expenses in a single account often leads to confusion and inaccurate budgeting.
*   **Lack of Insight**: Traditional spreadsheets or simple list-apps don't provide the *visual* context needed to spot spending habits (e.g., "Why did I spend so much on food this month?").
*   **Manual Tedium**: Calculating monthly totals and trends manually is time-consuming and prone to error.

## 🛠️ The Solution: WealthWise
**WealthWise** is a comprehensive, dual-mode financial management dashboard designed to bring clarity to chaos. It isn't just a transaction logger—it's an intelligent financial companion.

### What We Built
We developed a full-stack web application that allows users to:
1.  **Segregate Finances**: A built-in "Division Switcher" allows users to toggle instantly between **Personal** and **Office** modes. This keeps business expenses strictly separate from personal bills, while managing both under one login.
2.  **Visualize Data**: Instead of boring tables, users are greeted with interactive **Charts** (Bar, Line, and Area graphs) that visualize Income vs. Expense trends over weeks, months, or years.
3.  **Smart Management**:
    *   **Transactions**: Easy add/edit/delete flows with categorical tagging (e.g., 🍎 Food, 🚗 Transport).
    *   **Gap-Filling Intelligence**: Our trend engine intelligently fills in missing data dates to provide continuous, smooth timelines, ensuring users see the "whole picture" even on days they didn't spend money.
4.  **Secure & Scalable**: Built with **Node.js/Express** and **MongoDB** for a robust backend, and designed with **React/Tailwind** for a premium, responsive frontend experience. Secured with JWT authentication.


## 🎯 Impact
By using WealthWise, a user can answer the question *"Where did my money go?"* in seconds. The ability to seamlessly switch contexts from "Home Budget" to "Office Petty Cash" solves the specific pain point of the gig-economy worker or freelancer who wears multiple hats.
